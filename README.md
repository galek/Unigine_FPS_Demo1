# Unigine_FPS_Demo1
A FPS game demo developed with Unigine.

This is an empty project intended for developing a FPS game, which contains a player hidden behind the screen who moves with 
pressing of WASD Keys. There should also be some simple basic effects such as phsical interactions, shotting particle effects, 
and so on;
Some impressing artical effects will be added later, and also the player's animation;
